// output under contracts/, plus the dependency copies it emits at the repo root.

// Each block below is a workaround; its comment notes which upstream transpiler feature would let it be
// removed. Implementing feature n removes every block that references TODO(n); when all are done this whole
// script (and the -N excludes in transpile.sh, TODO(5)) go away. The features:
//   TODO(1) reuse a dependency's already-published upgradeable counterpart: remap imports to it, don't re-transpile
//   TODO(2) a configurable vendor output dir for deps with NO published upgradeable: emit there + fix imports
//   TODO(3) peer as a per-dependency source-prefix -> package map, so scoped deps aren't double-prefixed
//   TODO(4) WithInit generation skips abstract contracts
//   TODO(5) add-namespace-struct strips visibility from a var it moves into the storage struct  [see transpile.sh]
